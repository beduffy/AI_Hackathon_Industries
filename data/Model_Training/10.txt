TEAM PROGRESS TO DATE 
 Data Conversion 
Common Demand – do all records have a CD ID?? 
Yes, all records will have a CD ID.  
There can be multiple demand events for a single Demand record due to updates – all will share that CD ID. 
There is a unique Message ID to identify the events for each Demand record.

TEAM PLANNED WORK / TO DO 
   
Data Conversion 
Question from Common Demand – Is there a requirement to tag the Optional Skills as 1, 2, 3 etc? Will a weighting be placed on them during execution of the algorithms? [KS] Primary will be the main focus. No need to determine ordering for Optional.
